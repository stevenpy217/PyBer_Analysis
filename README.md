# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The PyBer project was created to anlayze the major data from Jan to May of 2019 for PyBer which is a ride-share company. The data included number of rides, drivers, fares, average ride per driver and fare, and total fare by city type. 


## Results


The results showed that the more rides and drivers, the average fare per ride and driver went down. The less the number of rides and drivers, the average pride per ride and driver went up. This is shown in the below table. The highest performing city type was Urban, Suburban, and Rural. As you can see from the Total Fares amount, Urban out performed the other city types in this analysis. 




## Summary


My recommendation to Pyber will be to increase the amount of drivers in Rural areas to match demand. Also decreasing the average fare per ride in Rural area can help lure in new customers to start using Pyber. Another recommendation is to reduce the number od drivers from Urban city because it shows that there is excessive number of drivers compared to the total number of rides.
